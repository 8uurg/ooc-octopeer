## Notes
* I took a closer look at you're point system and am now correcting earlier feedback:
	* You're point system is ambiguous when it comes to the total time each team member spent.
	* See the pdf in the sprint_5 folder for details
* Good reflection except I don't see mention of SIG and creating a GitHub clone
