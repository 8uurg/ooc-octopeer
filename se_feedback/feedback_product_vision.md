## General

* Inconsistent writing of Bitbucket, i.e. sometimes you use BitBucket and somtimes you use Bitbucket.
* I like how you make a clear distinction between the two target groups - researchers and developers.

## An Introduction to 'Octopeer for Bitbucket'

-

## Octopeer for Researchers

* A bit odd style of writing once you start to discuss prior work done by Rahman and Roy, and JÃ¼rjens et al.

## Octopeer for Developers

-

## What Octopeer Can Do for You

-

## The Focal User

* The user stories should be used to describe product attributes, i.e. functional and non-functional requirements. I think you kind of missed the point.

## Difference with Competing Tools

* I would **not** consider GHTorrent as competitor because it is still useful for general GitHub data and can be used to improve Octopeer. In other words, we do not want to reinvent the wheel and use GHTorrent instead when appropriate.
* Would love to hear how Bitbucket provides more support to code reviewers than GitHub.
