## Notes
* Actual Total Effort (points) needs a baseline or you need to use hours. It's unclear how much work 30 (example) points.
* In the problem section adding a clear section about your solution.
* For situations such as problem 2, still provide your solution as being "We haven't really figured out how to fix this, so next week we are going to spend sometime to do this"
	* Not knowing is fine, a team discussion is a valid solution
