## Notes
* In the problem section adding a clear section about your solution.
* The point system is accurate but overly complex (x^1.598)
	* If it works, it works and focus on other things (see below)

##Notes
* ADD
	* Good work on the coding clarification choices
	* The throttling of requests should be added in the ADD
* Code
	* Are all the interfaces used?
		* If so a class diagram detailing this in the ADD would make this a lot clearer
* Excellent Code Reviews
* Excellent Tooling and Testing
* Note to increase the Testing grade you need to
	* provide documentation and convince me you've tested to the max
	* increase the coverage further if reasonable
