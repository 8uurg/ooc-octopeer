## Notes
* Specify the User stories more, need to be more clearly defined, too high level
* A-E defined prioritisation only A-C is used (usually means you didn't include enough tasks or wrong granularity)
* Why was Problem 1-3, a problem. For future sprints add motivation as to how the problem affected the workflow.
* No adjustments for the next Sprint? If none, why not.
* Please add a table with the total number of hours per person
