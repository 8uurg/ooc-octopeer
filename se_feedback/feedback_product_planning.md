##Notes
* Well done, good to see the feedback was taken into account.
* Roadmap is much better than the draft version
* Analysis, the tool is for data collection but first users should be able to improve with this tool as well; -1 for not including this aspect
* As a user I want the extension to be intuitive.
	* This is a rather ambiguous user story
* No multiple interpretations are possible in any part of the text
	* Nice thought but ultimately not possible, ambiguity is just part of natural language; good goal to limit it as much as possible
