The Sprint Plan will be graded when you turn in the retorspective this Friday (April 29).

* N.A. is not a well defined user story, documentation would be better
* 28 hours * 5 people = 140 development hours, tasks should be split more (ex. Product Planning has more sub tasks)
* Why is Cas repsonsible for the Product Planning (even though he hasn't been assigned)
* All can't be responsible for the Architecture Design
* Tasks look evenly split though an overview of how much work each member has been allocated would be nice. Product Vision is 9 points for 3 people. Does that mean together 9 points of work or is that 9 points per person. A table makes it much clearer how you calculate these totals.
