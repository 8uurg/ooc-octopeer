## Notes
* Well done taking the feedback into account
* Repeated tasks (Write chapter on description/reflection/analysis) require some notes or find anothe way of defining the tasks
* Also no user story associated with some task groups, makes it hard to know what these tasks are about.
* Thanks for adding the table.
